Now, I am quite a small person so I obviously don't understand the struggles these people face. However I do value personal space (and especially on longer flights). This has lead me to the unfortunate opinion that these people should be required to purchase a second ticket, mostly on smaller aircraft, to accomodate to their needs. I don't like this opinion I have, but I can't help but think this when I'm sitting next to a complete stranger and they're taking up half of my seat, as well as theirs. "

It will record any audio and behaviors of the officers and the individuals they come in contact with. Therefore, if a crime is committed - whether it be by an officer or otherwise - it will be caught on camera, and the video evidence cannot lie. Additionally, these body cameras will influence the behaviors of the officer as well as anyone being recorded, leading to less crime by police officers and against police officers.

How is sitting during the National Anthem showing disrespect to the military? 

I completely understand how many are saying that is disrespectful to the flag and what it represents, but what about that makes it disrespectful to our military? In my opinion, it’s anything but disrespectful to the military because our military fight to preserve our democracy, and the freedom of speech is something that falls within democracy. The way I see it, they’re just expressing themselves in a way they see fit, whether it is effective or not. 

Perhaps it would be different if I was part of a military family or if I was in the military, but I just don’t see the connection that many others are seeing, and I’d like to understand that point of view. "

Have you ever thought about how he or she feels?! Do you think they want to be depressed? Do you think they wanted to feel that way? While everyone can live their day relatively normally, everyday is a living nightmare for them and I'm saying this from experience as someone who was diagnosed with depression and has to take medicine.

But no. They have to continue just so other people can have a good conscience and live their lives not understanding how much pain the other party is feeling. That is selfish. Wanting someone to continue hurting themselves not because you care about them but because you'll feel bad... THAT'S SELFISH! You're not considering the pain they feel but prioritizing your own!

Bringing more people in just to have more citizens that can't make it over the poverty line doesn't make sense. Before we push to take in more immigrants, we should first provide the aid that would be given to people coming in to the lower class that is already in America. Although through the view of humanitarianism this doesn't seem fair to the people waiting for the opportunity to come to the US, this isn't the right move economically.

"6","DavidlikesPeace","CMV: people who care about the environment should still have kids, and people who don't want kids should not use carbon footprints as their reason not to have kids","null","13","4","0","4","Every week some redditor comments about how their personal decision to not have kids is going to remake the world into a better, more environmentally sustainable place. Now, everybody clearly has the right to have kids or not. But the advertised logic makes no sense.


If environmentalism was the main reason to not have kids, the people who don't give a shit about carbon footprints will have kids. While children are hardly direct clones of their parents, I believe that they often listen to and are affected by their parent's beliefs, even if their parents are redditors.


If you care about the environment, trying to help educate the next generation in being equally aware of its beauty and fragility makes far more sense to me than neutering oneself. In fact, it's hard to think of a more counterproductive political strategy than to purposefully eliminate a chance to raise aware, smart children who care about the environment. And if you simply don't want to have children, finding a better or more honest reason is the more mature thing to do too.


I think redditors who cite the environment as a reason to not have children are either using that as a socially easy excuse, or are naive about the long-term repercussions if all green friendly people did the same.

We don't even have to look back too far in American history to find a president far more destructive to lives and freedom.

"8","finchdad","CMV: It isn't necessarily a good idea for Costa Rica to not have a military in the modern world.","null","1","2","0","2","Costa Rica hasn't had a military for almost 70 years, and they're very proud of it. It's mostly worked out so far ([although I wish they would do more about shark finning and the Taiwanese mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_fin_trading_in_Costa_Rica)). I think it's an interesting experiment that Costa Rica opted out of armed forces, especially considering what a colossal waste of taxpayer money the U.S. military has become (and the arguable causes for which we fight many of our wars). I honestly hope it works out because that means there was perpetual peace.

But I wish they would keep their risky experiment to themselves a little more. I had this arrogant Costa Rican professor who loved to look down her nose at other countries and say "isn't it great that we can spend our money on our people instead of the military", while passing the buck for maintaining peace. The silly thing is that Costa Rica couldn't help themselves in an emergency and is laughably uninterested in helping anybody else. What if Panama didn't have a military, and the Colombian drug cartels moved into Costa Rica? Or what if Nicaragua decided to invade Costa Rica again, or if Costa Rica had a natural disaster that required support from an organization like the national guard? The world would have to pay the bill because Costa Rica was too noble to be prepared for it. Again, there is no global obligation for a country to protect itself, but the braggadocio about not needing a military is literally at the expense of other countries and it should not be universally praised.

"9","elhawiyeh","CMV: It is immoral to expect or require private citizens to stand for the anthem.","null","38","3","0","3","As a child, I remember being told to recite the pledge and put my hand on my heart for the anthem, and doing so only reluctantly. I knew vaguely what I was supporting, but there was never a satisfactory why. Now, in my adult life, I have that answer, but only after weighing seriously if my country as an institution was in fact worth supporting. But at the time I realized I was being compelled to show support for something I didn't really understand.

There is something fundamentally wrong with requiring someone to show allegiance to the country. Enforcing patriotism invites either zealotry or hypocrisy. When we are required to show conviction, what was once genuine sentiment becomes lost in ritual. Standing for one's beliefs becomes compliance with the norm. Self-expression becomes banal conformity.

Genuine respect cannot be compelled

"10","gallez","CMV: the US is no more 'free' than most Western European countries","null","116","60","0","60","...and a lot less free in a number of aspects.

Many Americans are proud of the 'freedom' that their country represents. As someone who has spent time in a number of European countries and in the US, I wonder how exactly is America 'freer' than Europe?

A few things of varying impact on people's lives, listed in random order:

- in the US, you are free to go to war and get killed in the Middle East at the age of 17. You cannot legally have a beer until you turn 21;

- in the US, unless you are born in a very wealthy family (think top 5% of all American households) you cannot graduate from a decent college without accruing tens of thousands of dollars in debt. If you are born in a black/Hispanic family living in a trailer park, good luck, waiting tables at Applebee's is as good as it's going to get;

- (this is the most ridiculous one) if you were not born in the US but would like to become an American citizen, you have to undergo the most rigorous admission process in the world (barring maybe Australia). Under the current President, if you are a citizen of one of a few 'problematic' countries, you cannot even enter the US legally. So much for a country that prides itself on being free and has redditors saying 'but anyone who wants to be an American can become one!';

- tons of plainly dumb laws, such as the fact that you cannot drink alcohol when you are a passenger in a car.

I guess my point is, I would really love to know what freedoms America has that countries like Germany, Belgium, Switzerland or Spain don't. I mean, if so many people have fought and died for the American freedom, there must be plenty to fight and die for, right?


**edit:** Plenty of good points here, I will be issuing some deltas soon. Thank you for helping me realize that freedom is not the same things as happiness and general wellbeing. America is indeed more free than Europe, even if this freedom is related to things I personally don't care that much about (hate speech, gun laws etc.).

"11","Disciple_Of_Khorne","CMV: Gun control in the UK isn't needed this strictly.","null","18","2","0","2","People are allowed cars, cars are much more deadly than a gun, you can't stop a car but you can stop a gun wielder.
More than 10 percent of murders are done with a gun anyway, obviously the law isn't working brilliantly and when most people don't have guns they can kill more people.
We are being bombed like every other week, if people can sneak in bombs they can sneak in pistols, might as well have everyone on equal grounds.
But I say only handguns or pretty much guns which aren't rapid fire, rapid fire guns aren't needed and if you are shooting an attacker you have a higher chance of shooting an innocent and much more kills when shot into a crowd, if everyone had a handgun people would be more likely to be cautious or not do it and a good shot will put an attacker down.
So reddit, can you change my view?"
"12","aretheyaliens","CMV: CMV: As someone who is pro-choice, I don't think being pro-life is inherently anti-woman.","null","106","15","0","15","Don't get me wrong, I think abortion should be legal. But I don't think all or even most pro-lifers are misogynists. After all, there's nearly as many women who are pro-life as there are men.

There seems to be this idea that people who want to make abortion illegal or restricted are composed primarily of men who take pleasure in controlling women's bodies and denying them their human rights, which totally ignores the fact that many religious people view fetuses as possessing a soul and human nature. There's also a minority of atheists that consider the unborn to be human.

I think you can honestly believe that the fetus has more of a right to live than the woman has the right to get an abortion, without having a negative opinion of women or believing they are inferior to men. I don't agree with that, but I think it's a respectable position.

I think accusing pro-lifers of misogyny in a knee-jerk fashion is just as moralizing and self-righteous as pro lifers calling women who get abortions murderers.

For example if someone is pulled over by a cop and shows their PBA card they don't get a ticket. The legal system is supposed to protect the citizens and we have laws to keep everyone safe. Special treatment to those with a PBA card enables those people to not follow simple laws like abiding by the speed limit and stopping at stop signs. PBA cards are basically the equivalent to bribing a police officer with money.

"14","random_name_13","CMV: Voting new people into office will not actually fix our government","null","34","2","0","2","Every day I get more and more jaded about our government and it is extremely depressing. It feels like everyone is corrupt and they are taking our money and being tremendously careless and wasteful ($700 Billion for Defense). It is overwhelmingly disheartening to believe that our government no longer makes decisions with the peoples' best interest in mind, but instead, the decisions are solely focused on what will make them the most money.

I don't believe it is a Democrat vs. Republican issue. We are being told to vote on party lines and that by voting for the person who represents your political party, you can change the outcome. In reality, my view is that this is a have vs. have-not or rich vs. poor scenario and that those in power will continue to make decisions that only benefit elites. I also believe that the system supports this notion and that in order to make it to a high-ranking position with any real power of change, you must also make decisions that benefit the elite as opposed to the common man.

My overall view is that voting new people into office will not fix the problem. The problem with our government is so ingrained in the system that a new person, who truly supports the people, would never be able to make it into power and create real change. They face so many roadblocks by not being part of "the club" and they could never acquire enough money to actually make it in.

Please change my view because it is really depressing to believe that there is little hope that our current system of governance can escape from the current levels of corruption.

As I've matured, I realized that the things I question most (and am the most critical of) are the things I feel a connection to. In the classroom, this translated to me questioning the explanation/reasoning behind all of my favorite subjects (mathematics, history, and science). 

I've always loved my country and I feel that I am more patriotic than most - but, I also hold an extremely distrustful view of our current federal and state governments. I question the 'truth' they tell us and I doubt the intentions of those who work within it. Yet, I still love my country and am proud to be an American. I think the desire to be critical (and not blindly trust) the US government is the most patriotic thing you can do for the country (in terms of protecting the American people and their land).

"16","LeifEriksonASDF","CMV: The more popular something becomes, the worse its fanbase gets","null","42","44","0","44","Or to put it in a more specific way: Once a fanbase passes a certain threshold of popularity (which varies on a case to case basis), the quality of the fanbase begins decreasing.

By "getting worse", what I mean is the fanbase gets more diluted with low-information and fair-weather fans, who care less about the "etiquette" and "culture" of the fanbase beforehand, and generally brings the average quality of discourse down. I've probably done a terrible job of explaining this phenomenon, but hopefully I've conveyed what I mean somewhat clearly, as I feel this has occurred several times on Reddit to subs that start making the front page or r/all more often, and is easily observable.

This has happened to several media that I consume (video games, movies, TV, etc), to many subreddits and other forums I visit, and even to my own IRL friend groups, which feel less connected as they grow bigger. At this point I feel like it's almost a law of the universe, though I do know some people disagree with me. "
"17","jtucker100","CMV:People should evacuate from large hurricanes","null","8","1","0","1","Watching hurricane coverage from Michigan over the years, I’ve often wondered why people do not evacuate areas that will be hit by a large hurricane.

Repeatedly, the media reports that an area is under an evacuation order before parading local people who boldly proclaim that they are ‘going to ride it out.’ It’s hard for me to understand why people want to stay in places when their lives might be in jeopardy. I can certainly understand someone’s reluctance to leave their home and everything they have worked for, but I do not understand what they hope to accomplish by staying behind and risking their lives. When people stay behind, what good are they doing for their homes? They can’t keep the damage from happening, so why stay?

Honestly, it’s hard not to think the people you see on the news boldly ignoring evacuation orders are not stupid. At best, they come across as stubborn, which does not make their choice seem any more rational. When they are being interviewed and asked why they are staying, the answer is always something like, ‘this is my home’ or ‘I’ve been through storms before.’ Certainly, I understand these arguments for smaller storms, but, to hurricane free me, they make no sense as reasons to stay for larger historical storms. I know the weather forecasters have been wrong plenty of times in the past and storms are not as severe as predicted, but they have often been right and an area is devastated. I’m thinking specifically about Hurricane Katrina. Is there a method to this madness that does not come across in the interviews we see on TV?

Finally, when I think of the first responders who risk their lives to save people who stay behind and get into trouble, their choice not to leave seems beyond irresponsible. Furthermore, I often wonder if some of the challenges an area might face after the storm might be mitigated if more people evacuated. It seems reasonable that if less people where in an area, it would be easier for workers to clear debris, restore power, and begin cleaning up after storm surge before people return from an evacuation. Having a lot of people living in an area with a damaged infrastructure seems like a recipe for disaster because supplies would be difficult to acquire and sanitation would be difficult to maintain. I’ve seen requests for diapers and other types of supplies following the most recent hurricanes, and I can’t help but think that fewer people would mean fewer supplies that would be needed following the storm. Wouldn’t those people be better off staying somewhere they could easily get drinking water and flush toilets?

As a northerner, riding out a big storm just seems crazy to me, but more recently, I’ve been wondering what I don’t know about hurricanes that is not being reported. Of course, in the case of an island, like Puerto Rico, an entire population cannot be evacuated. However, it seems like places in the continental United States should be able to evacuate. If you have responses to my reasons for thinking people should evacuate for large storms, please change my view.

"18","chinmakes5","CMV: Decreasing taxes and regulation won't do much to create more jobs and increase pay.","null","4","0","0","0","This seems to be a tenet of many CEOs and conservatives. Was watching the CEOs of Citibank and IBM talking about how important this is. They seemed to be alluding to the fact that if they had tax breaks and less regulation they would be expanding. But those two companies had net profits of over $2 billion EACH in the 2nd QUARTER. If $2 billion a quarter isn't enough to spur expansion, how much is enough? 

It isn't just huge companies that are profitable. The stock market has grown by over 250% in the last 8 years. Investors have had record profits while worker's pay has remained flat. 

IMO, right now, the investor has so much power companies can't expand. Expansion is risky. Why mess with record profits? 250% is unsustainable, yet investors pressure companies to beat last years record profits. 
 
 Increased productivity is the buzz word because it is a big reason companies are so profitable. Why would additional profits cause companies to pay more and expand (reduce productivity?) It has been very profitable for companies to run lean and mean.

Now I get that there will be some increased employment, but record profits havn't spurred investment why will adding to that profit change things? Do we need to give investors 20%, 30% or more in yearly profits, increase the debt and increase pollution in return for a slight bump in wages and employment?

The other side believes that expansion happens when demand increases. Increasing salary for the many is a much more effective way to increase demand (for a consumer product) than increasing profits for the few, (which should eventually lead to increased profits for the few anyway.)

"19","GallowFroot","CMV: It's understandable that women rated 80% of men on OKCupid as "Below Average"","null","70","13","0","13","When people think "average", they think, "not the most handsome, but not ugly", or some variation of that, to say, "so-so".


Must of us jump to the assumption that 50% of men are above average, and 50% are under. And I would argue that in general this has held true.


However, if women consider overweight men to be "below average", and if half the population is overweight, than 50% of men automatically are rated "below average". 


It doesn't mean women are hypocritical, it's a reflection of what men look like.

"20","Brushner","CMV: The only way to solve the Rohingya crisis/massacre outside of direct military intervention is to move them somewhere else.","null","8","5","0","5","So if you didnt know the Rohingya people of the Rakhine state of Myanmar are basically being ethnically cleansed, the history is grey and complex but right now thousands are getting killed and hundreds of thousands are getting kicked out by the Myanmar army and local vigilante groups with no signs of stopping and to top it off its being supported by the public who interrupt and destroy foreign aid meant for the Rohingya. The Rohingya people have to be moved to another country so that the killing will stop, now which country or countries I dont know but thats another issue. Change from within is just not feasible since the current Myanmar Prime MInister/State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi cant really do much since she doesnt have control of the military and condemning the massacre would mean opposing the will of the public which would get her ousted. Sanctions wont do much since Myanmar already has a few sanctions in place due to a military coup decades ago, is too poor and uneducated so they would only lash out even harder against the people causing the sanctions and countries like India and China would veto or ignore said sanctions. Given we do have military intervention on the table that "we" would just be America with a handful of foreign soldiers and theres just no support for it, India and China would oppose it, nothing to gain and considering the terrain its just another Vietnam war waiting.


Also heres a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSxsPHIJQbo) talking about the problem in more detail.

"21","Cultleadership","CMV: I think modern day society has ruined my dream of ever becoming a housewife","null","112","1","0","1","Okay, so I'm not a very ambitious person never have been, probably never will be. I am relatively smart and enjoy my independence, it's not like I want to be some slave to a man or don't respect myself. I simply just don't want to be forced into the world of work, back in the day expectations for women were to find a husband and start a family. That's what I want. I'm not saying all women should do that and it's should be up to the individual but in this day and age that mentality has been completely smothered out of society.

Men hate the idea of taking care of a women financially because she's considered a "gold digger" or "lazy" and women hate the idea of taking care of her home and her family because she's considered "weak" or "submissive" or "has zero respect for herself". If a women wants to be a housewife she is shamed and ridiculed.

I'm 20 and I have no certainty about what I want except for the fact I want a family. All a housewife has to do is keep her home nice, look after herself and look after the kids and her husband. She has time to get her hair done and gossip and day drink and whatever else haha. But seriously, I'm not saying everything about the concept works but Ya know. I literally only wanna go to uni to meet a husband, I cried last week cause I'm 20 and still haven't found a potential husband, I wanted to start my family asap, but I come from a family of academics, and ambitious people, my mum literally won't LET me move out because she wants me to get a degree first before I have to start paying rent and not having enough time or money to study. 

There's more to my reasoning, but that's pretty much it. I don't want to work, I don't want to have to and I don't think it's fair that this day and age has ruined the concept just because of "feminism" and "empowerment"

EDIT: the comment about getting hair done and day drinking was half a joke I know there's way more to being a housewife than that lol "
"22","visualize_and_attack","CMV:Trump's acknowledgement of the anthem protest is good for progress.","null","34","1","0","1","Although Trump has made it clear that he sees the protest of kneeling during the national anthem as a disgrace and disrespectful to America, I believe that it is in fact a positive. Would it be even more of a positive if he supported the athletes? Yes. But, It's still giving the cause a lot of publicity and has got everyone talking which is exactly what the protest was hoping to achieve.

A lot of people are saying he should be focusing on other things. But I think the violence against blacks in America should be a focus for the president. So although he is not meaning to, he is helping.

Change my view!

"23","PM_ME_STUDENT_FEES","CMV: gender is a social construct, therefore transgenderism should not exist.","null","38","0","0","0","One of the things I truly believe is that gender is a social construct. Doing "manly" things does not make a male and doing "girly" things does not make a female.

It gets me to the point of what causes transgenderism. If we had a society where gender truly didn't matter, would transgenderism exist? I don't think so.

In my own idea, (and I hope this doesn't offend, because I could be wrong), gender dysphoria is a mental condition that causes people to believe they are of the wrong gender. But as gender shouldn't (and imo doesn't) matter, my opinion that causes this is the want as a (biological) male or female is the want to be feminine or masculine. 

We are taught from a young age to adhere to your gender, and this is what causes this apprehension to do feminine things if you're a man or masculine ones if you're a woman. 

It's gotten to a point recently where for some that the idea of a man having a sex change and wearing feminine clothes is more normal and accepted then a man simply wearing feminine clothes. Society should push harder for the acceptance of people doing whatever they want - and I would think gender dysphoria would happen less (if not at all.)

EDIT: Wanted to just note to everyone, thanks for participating in this discussion in good faith. I understand this is a hard topic to discuss."
"24","angels_fan","CMV: Peter Jackson made the right call in leaving out Tom Bombadil and Goldberry","null","34","36","0","36","Fans of the Lord of the Rings trilogy have long lamented that Peter Jackson did not include the story of Tom Bombadil and Goldberry in the film adaptation. 

According to Wikipedia, Peter Jackson stated that the reason the character was omitted from his film was because, in the view of him and his co-writers, Bombadil does little to advance the story, and would make their film unnecessarily long. 

I completely agree.

In the books, these two are completely throwaway characters that served literally no purpose in Frodo's quest. They are a neat bit of lore, but aside from that, would have just extended the film by another 30-40 minutes.

"25","wastagaswe","CMV: Beheading is not more barbaric than any other form of execution.","null","47","25","0","25","I feel like beheading gets a bad rep because of Saudi Arabia, which is the only country that continues this practice. There are other countries like Yemen and Qatar in which beheading is legal, but it is rarely done anymore. 

I don't understand why beheading is any worse than the rope, electric chair, etc. It is very quick and results in the least amount of pain. I understand if somebody thinks any form of execution is barbaric, but where is the logic that beheading is worse than other executions?

This is assuming of course, that the one doing the beheading knows how to do it properly, and doesn't end up having to hack at the head several times like Theon in Game of Thrones.
