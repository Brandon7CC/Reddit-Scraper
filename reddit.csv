What is there to gain from not doing anything about climate change if you are putting earth and therefore humanity at risk. The effects may not be so detrimental that humanity is struggling to survive for another thousand years, but is sacrificing humanity as a species in the long run worth anything we are doing now? In the past the U.S. has prepared for dangerous things such as nuclear war, which was a valid threat, but not guaranteed to happen, but we prepared for it anyway. Why is climate change different? Just because it is not as instant or simple as a bomb being dropped, it is just as if not more dangerous.

"2","TonyWrocks","CMV: The American stock market is liable to be more stable in the modern era than it has in the past because of the trend towards mutual fund &amp; ETF trading - and away from individual stocks.","null","19","42","0","42","In the past, ordinary investors primarily traded individual stocks - either on the recommendation of a broker - or even their neighbor. 

The old E.F. Hutton commercials come to mind in which somebody would have a hot tip on an up and coming company that was going to make their investors rich quickly, and everybody stopped what they were doing to listen and get in on it.

In the modern Jack-Bogle-inspired era of investing, I have observed people moving away from individual stocks because of the inherent risk in betting on a single company, and instead investing in mutual funds and ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) because this represents "betting on the market" as a whole instead. 

I believe that's a much safer bet because it's tied to overall market growth, which is less volatile.

My contention, then, is that the massive swings we once saw during times of correction were at least partially caused by this get-rich-quick approach of looking for the next Cisco or Microsoft or GE, rather than the modern buy-and-hold larger funds approach.

If I am correct, then we'll see smaller swings because people are not moving in and out of stocks as they come into, and fall out of, favor.

What important factor have I missed? Change my view!

It’s something I never thought of and this idea started to change my idea of what we consider the “natural” world. After all...

Humans aren’t separate from nature. We are a part of it just like any other biological organism. We have made massive technological advances but we and everything we do is natural. Nature allowed for us to make said advancements and everything traces back to it. 

The modern cities we live in are just as natural as the small settlements our ancestors made out of wood, for example. A modified stone tool is just as natural as the smart phone I’m using to type this. "
"4","Andy24z","CMV:The National Anthem should not be played prior to sporting events.","null","43","350","0","350","Ultimately sports are a form of entertainment and I can’t think of other entertainment events that involve the national anthem. I have never been to a movie, play, concert, or comedy show that started off with everyone standing for the anthem. What makes an athletic competition so different that they require that the anthem be performed? And as sports leagues diversify and become more international, will they need to incorporate several anthems into pregame ceremonies so as to fairly represent all those participating in the event? That would push start times back considerably. Networks had even stopped broadcasting the anthem before most regular season games and only the recent interest in player protests has brought the coverage back.

"5","Forrestokun","CMV: The Common WW2 Nazi soldier was not a bad person","null","104","155","0","155","When one looks back at world war two, they see the biggest bad guys as the Nazi's, and for good reason two. Not only did they attempt to conquer the world they also slaughtered millions of people simply because of their religion. However, the atrocious people who did these acts were the leader: Hitler, Goebbels, and Göring and the soldier that ran the camps. These people were the true monsters because they knew about the problem and contributed to it. This is where my point comes in, yes these people were horrible, however, the common soldier on the frontline either had no idea what was happening or did not understand the extent of what it was. They were simply fighting for their country, something some people find noble. To sum it all up what bugs me is when people say that the Nazis were terrible people, in fact, however, it was the leaders. The soldiers were fighting because they were told to.

"6","mat_n_cheese","CMV: Movie ticket and concession prices are reasonable.","null","12","18","0","18","Many people complain about how fast ticket prices have risen and how expensive the concessions are at movie theaters, but I think they are fairly priced. Movie theaters are often getting less than 25% of the ticket sales, as most of it is going back to the movie studios. For the first month or so they aren't making much, if any, money from a film. It is not until it has been out for a while and is still popular that the profits begin to show. 

The only other way to recoup their expenses is their concession sales. The movie studios also don't make much money on a movie unless it's a blockbuster hit. Many movies make less than it cost to produce them, and the listed movie budget is often far less than the true cost due to a lot of advertising films purchase."
"7","AlexDChristen","CMV: States should not be represented in the Senate in the modern USA","null","10","8","0","8","First of all, let me preface this by conceding that at foundation of the United States, the formation of the Senate made sense. At the time States were much more like independent countries and regional interests were much more intense than they are now. States had to feel safe in the union. 

However, with the modern political divisions of the United States, equal state representation no longer holds much weight. First, the fundamental idea of democracy is that the people should hold the power (Yes, I am assuming democracy is good and that the U.S. more or less qualifies as a democracy, and not a republic, though that distinction is irrelevant); With equal state representation in the senate, certain voters get much more influence over national politics than other states, such as Wyoming and Alaska to New York and Texas. Why should an arbitrarily drawn line determine how much power your vote has? Second, national politics no longer divides itself by state interest; the de facto case is that it is a party divide across the country as a whole is the real competition. Thus, the equal senate current advantages the republicans solely because they often resonate with rural Americans on national issues, and yet provide little local interest. In recent years, the parties that have won more of the vote have won less seats than they deserve based on arbitrarily drawn state divisions (Yes, most states after the original 13 were more or less eyeballed into existence by drawing a random rectangle). 

The common argument that small states will loose their rights does not hold much weight, because thats precisely the goal of changing the senate: too remove the advantage of small states. To change my view you have to demonstrate a strong reason why small states ought to be protected. One common argument for this is to protect from the "tyranny of the majority." This argument falters because the answer to a tyranny by the majority is not the tyranny of the minority which the the small state argument upholds. Furthermore, in a two party system like ours, their is always a majority of one party that is usually in control of both houses. In fact right now we have a minority supported majority government. Another argument I hear is that the senate is to protect from the uninformed masses leading us to doom. This argument fails as well given that the Senate doesn't actually protect against that with its current electorate: the people. Instead like state before, the senate is just an arbitrary division of which citizens get more voting power. The senate only can remotely be regarded as a safeguard against the will of the people if you do not allow the people to vote for it and thats more of an argument over if democracy is a good government. 

Finally, to prevent arguments stating there is no better alternative, I propose this quick change. Instead of having the senate represent states, create a national proportional vote for the senate; citizens would vote for a party and the overall percentage of votes a party receives gives it a corresponding number of seats: 32% of the vote would give a party 32 of 100 total seats. This also has the added bonus of undermining the two party system. 

Note to commentors: I am busy student so I have limited time to devote to writing arguments here, but I will try to reply and have discussions with as many of you as I can. Go ahead and try to change my view!

"8","ATXENG","CMV: Cleaning kitchen sink w/ scrub brush makes the brush clean as well","null","4","6","0","6","So my wife and I are having an argument. I've got a bristle scrub brush w/ built in soap dispenser (oxo) and use it to wipe out the inside of the kitchen sink and rinse w/ water/soap/chemicals. Think: raw meat juice from food prep, junk and grime, grease from pans, etc.

She's grossed out, saying that the sink is dirty and now the brush is dirty, which will then transfer to dishes.

Isn't that the point? Using soap and water (and possibly stronger stuff like baking soda or bleach) and then scrubbing makes the sink clean and wouldn't the brush be clean as well?

Plus, its a bristle brush made of plastic that dries out. I imagine bacteria can't really live long on it anyway, unlike a sponge that holds moisture and surface area for bacteria.

So CMV? Is it ok to clean out the kitchen sink w/ a bristle brush and then wash and rinse and then use that to clean other dishes?"
"9","mp3258","CMV: Schools need to be stricter when enforcing the nut allergy policy","null","22","7","0","7","I am of the opinion that the degree of monitoring that occurs in schools, regarding a nut allergy, should be enforced more intensely. This reason for this belief is the thousands of parents, who may be packing their children's lunches, are ignorant and unaware of a severe allergy a fellow classmate might have towards nuts. I suggest teachers and administrators should take action in the public and private schooling systems by educating parent's, and the children themselves, of the medical incident that can be avoided by not bringing nuts to school. Some schools implement 'Nut Free Zone' sign, but this could not be totally effective. The children may see it, but how about the parents? Education and the nut allergy policy needs to be enforced on a stricter level.

A is the attacker. B is the victim. C is us/ the spectator. A attacks B. I as a C have no moral obligation to go and help B and me making this decision of not going doesnt make me a bad person. It is not my place to risk my life. It is though my obligation to seek help, either by calling the police or seeking someone to do so. If I do not so I made an evil act. Of course this will not be so easy to argue but I think this would be the core of my argument.

"11","biehn","CMV: There is a finite number of universes in the Many-Worlds Theory","null","16","7","0","7","I got into a debate about whether there are an infinite number of universes in the Multiverse and I think there isn't but please please tell me where my logic fails. It was hard to put into words but basically here's how I see it:

If we're going by Many-worlds theory, it starts with 1 possibility to which all the parallel universes branch off of to become. To make my point, I'm operating under a couple presumptions: the Universe has finite space and a finite amount of energy -- we know space itself is expanding but the total size of the universe should be still finite as long as the initial conditions are of finite space.

The quantum foam that makes spacetime is characterized to be measurable by the Planck length. The Planck length, being the minimum distance for distance itself to matter, can be used as a sort of cell size for an n-dimensional spatial grid where all possible positions of any piece of information can be mapped out in a coordinate form.

Energy and its various forms are what occupies these cells. By the first law of Thermodynamics, this means that there is a finite amount of arrangements of energy and all its forms, including matter, within the finite n-dimensional grid. This grid's size can vary every Planck time to compensate for the expansion of the universe but nevertheless is still finite.

The universal wavefunction in the many-worlds theory allows all possibilities at a given time to collapse into the "parallel universes" at the next Planck time. But nevertheless, as only a finite amount of time has occurred since the birth of the universe, there could only exist a finite amount of parallel universes by this theory at this current time. Although it is true that by every passage of a Planck time, the number of parallel universes existing within the Multiverse is growing at an exponential rate, it is not infinite unless of course, an infinite amount of time is allowed to elapse.

"12","Gay_Diesel_Mechanic","CMV: It would be safer to bring a shotgun camping than to not bring one.","null","50","58","0","58","I live in Alberta Canada, in a fairly remote town, and go camping often. I also go off roading once in a while. When we go camping it if often places that are not national parks nor are they official camp grounds that you pay for and park rangers patrolling to make sure your music is down after 11pm. I talked to my cousin and mentioned getting a shotgun for general target shooting, and to bring camping just in case. I know a lot of people who do this. Anyways, she said that she would feel unsafe knowing a gun was around people who were drinking. I said I would keep it in a case, unloaded but have the shells handy and be responsible with it. I probably would not even tell anybody it was in the truck. She says if a moose or a bear came close to us we could just go to the cars and be safe in there. I personally think that I would do everything possible to avoid using the gun in the first place. She says we could bring bear mace instead. 

Also it is legal to have a gun in a case, unloaded while camping as long as it is not in a national park. This all legal. 

I personally somewhat agree with her, but I can't account for every possible scenario that could happen in the woods. I think it wouldn't hurt to have a gun close by, and nobody would be in danger because of it. CMV."

This has lead me to the unfortunate opinion that these people should be required to purchase a second ticket, mostly on smaller aircraft, to accomodate to their needs. I don't like this opinion I have, but I can't help but think this when I'm sitting next to a complete stranger and they're taking up half of my seat, as well as theirs. "

"15","dickposner","CMV: "Gender" is a superfluous concept","null","77","5","0","5","When people distinguish between "sex" and "gender", they commonly refer to sex as a biological category, which gender is a social or personal identification category. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction

However, I see why gender actually should be considered a distinct concept from sex. Here is why:

1. gender is not a coherent concept without sex. I.e., if there was NO sex differentiation in human biology, the concept of gender would be meaningless. This means that the concept of gender is inherently and essentially based on the concept of sex.

2. We sometimes use different words to describe the same concept under slightly different contexts. For example, in America we say "corn" and also "corn on the cob." This is quite silly since "corn on the cob" is just "corn," but we say it to refer to when we're eating the corn without removing the kernels from the cob. 
 But does this mean the concept of "corn" and "corn on the cob" are truly distinct? No, the concept of "corn on the cob" is superfluous. If we got rid of that term and the concept, we don't really lose anything if we still have "corn." Similarly, neither "social roles" nor "self-identification" are sufficient to give rise to "gender" as a distinct concept from sex - they are merely elaborations of how people think about biological 
sex. 

3. If we got rid of the word and the concept of "gender", we can still use the word and concept of "sex" to accomplish everything that we want to use "gender" to do, without any confusion. 

For example, one might object to say: what about the concept of "gender dysphoria", how could you describe that only using biological sex? A possible response would be: "gender dysphoria" is the stress experienced by a person when their sex is not what they want their sex to be. We might use the term "sex dysphoria" instead. Here, I think that term actually more accurately captures the reality of the phenomenon than "gender dysphoria." Because if gender is just a social construct, then there is no reason why gender dysphoria can't be alleviated just by changing the social environment that one is in - for example, by living in an environment where traditional roles assigned to men and women are blurred or reversed. But there is no evidence that this is the case: people who suffer from gender dysphoria literally need hormones and treatment to mimic the BIOLOGICAL and PHYSICAL characteristics of the SEX they want to identify with, not just the "gender" they want to identify with. 

I think the best way to CMV would be to provide examples of how we use the concept of "gender" that can't be reduced to sex. 

I am aware of "third genders" like Hijra in Asia or the Mahu of Hawaii. Those individuals seem to be just how the culture use to describe either intersex individuals (individuals whose physical sex characteristics are ambiguous or indeterminate) or transgender individuals (individuals who do not want to be the sex that that they actually are). Since I can describe those individuals using the concept of sex alone, they do not convince me that the concept of "gender" is not superfluous.

"16","ddayzee","CMV: There ARE downsides to being attractive, even though the majority would disagree.","null","2","2","0","2","I understand that this post may come off the wrong way but I'm just going to be as straightforward as I can be.

Growing up, I've been lucky to receive many compliments from friends, families, and even strangers. Ever since I was little I was used to being called "pretty" and that I "should become a model! Or an actress!" Although I obviously know this is a blessing, at some point I began to see the downsides to this too.

When I was very young I obviously didn't think much of it because I didn't care about how I looked - I think most kids don't consider "attractiveness" a thing. But as I grew older I remember not feeling all that pretty. I would think to myself, "I can't be as pretty as everyone assumes/thinks of me to be." I felt like "being attractive" was a characteristic of mine that I needed to attain and I didn't think that I was achieving it. In high school I developed eating disorders and dealt with bulimia and body dysmorphic disorder until college. I am recovered now but it took an extremely long suffering to get here. I'm not saying that my disorders were caused by this issue specifically but it definitely made it difficult since I didn't feel that way yet many people assumed I "know" I'm attractive. 

Aside from my personal issues, I had to deal with social stigma too. Being "pretty" is often associated with being self-centered or bitchy. I've had "friends" who would invite me to go out and as I showed up in my casual clothes I found them all dressed up - apparently it was GNO (girls night out) and they all 'forgot' to tell me. "You look fine as is!" they said, but I can still remember the feeling of embarrassment and betrayal from that night. I've also had to deal with multiple accusations from girls saying I "seek attention." For example, when we were all hanging with a group of guys and girls one of them accused me of being "angry and quiet" because the guys "weren't giving me attention" - I was upset about something completely unrelated and that's what they assumed because I NEED attention from boys all the time. I've also been to the gym with a friend who made a comment about how I walk a certain way to "attract guys" at the gym. That was so ridiculous to me because that's something that's NEVER crossed my mind. When I'm at the gym, I'm there to WORKOUT. I don't even put on make up, I don't try to look pretty, yet I felt like anything that I do (/or don't do) rubs girls off the wrong way.

Another quick example is how I feel like my accomplishments are often belittled because of this trait. I remember when I got my first job as a sever I was recognized by my manager quickly. I took my job seriously and put in the work - I believe that I was given responsibilities and recognition for the effort that I put in. However, a worker told me in the middle of congratulating me that I'm "lucky" I'm pretty and that my manager likes me. She is an older lady who is very nice and I know she didn't mean to be rude, but to me that just seemed like being pretty was the only thing that got me to the top. In addition, while looking for jobs after college I've had many people tell me that I shouldn't worry since I'm pretty - as if my experiences and skills aren't going to matter whatsoever. It frustrates me to hear these things because I DO need to work just as hard as everyone else to be at the top and even if I do my efforts are disregarded and it is just because I'm "pretty." 

I have numerous examples but I don't want this post to be extremely long, so I'll wrap up here. All in all, I feel like being attractive is seen as an advantage in life, and although I do not disagree that there's some advantage for sure, just because one is considered attractive that doesn't mean their life is all perfect because of it. Being attractive can actually bring more problems too.

Yet at the same time it is widely considered unacceptable for a person to have a child rape/molestation fetish.

Assuming the fetish in both cases is only for simulated acts, not actual rape, I think the two must be considered morally equal, and either equally acceptable or unacceptable. In either case there's a depiction of an innocent person being traumatised.

Just to clarify, I'm not making a judgement of either fetish being inherently moral or immoral, only that they should be considered equally acceptable or unacceptable. And I have neither of these fetishes, so I'm not trying to validate myself or anything."
"19","reatter","CMV:Cops should have the right to stop you and ask you for your ID.","null","91","1","0","1","Cops should have the right to stop you and ask you for your ID (in all public spaces). Full stop.

I just stumbled upon a series of videos on Youtube, about cops who abuse their power, and about how attorneys, and other legal counselors getting into a vehicle search being pricks to cops who unlawfully want to search the vehicle, demand to see ID, and to arrest them for being non-cooperative.

It is about the ["stop and identify"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_identify_statutes) status.

Providing ID to the cops has not many negative condequences for the person who is stopped: They can run a background-check, you can go on with your life. It is important for police to be able to spot and verify people's IDs, in case a crime happens. 

That does not mean I am for abuse of power, and more often than not police officers have to have a "Reasonable Suspicion" or "Probable Cause" to order you to give ID/search you/arrest you (I am neither US citizen, nor am I a legal expert, so I am open to legal arguments against these actions).

Why would I as a upright citizen, who has done nothing wrong, be against IDing myself to the state authority.

I know FREEDOM (murica!) is spelled in all-uppercase in the US, but officers have time constraints, and cooperation of citizen with the police is important to ensure the safety of the country, and the ability of the police to detect criminal activity.

I am not against checks and balances, but to lay it into the hand of single states, and therefore into the hand of the pedestrian who is stopped, to decide if (s)he wants to ID, is pretty ridiculous. 

What on earth could be so important that you don't want to give the cops your ID card?

Convince me this is a bad idea, in principle!

"20","PLZ_PM_ME_UR_BUTT","CMV: The concept of gender identity is counterproductive to the goal of gender equality","null","51","5","0","5","First of all, in the interest of full disclosure, I want to admit the possibility that I may not entirely understand the concept of gender identity, or really even the idea of gender being distinguished from biological sex. I've had a lot of discussions and I've read a lot of articles, but I've had trouble finding any clear explanation of what gender actually is. If you can clarify this for me, that alone may be enough to adjust my view.

That being said, it seems to me that the concept of gender identity relies on the notion that certain traits and characteristics are inherently male or female. For someone who is biologically male to identify as female, there must be something for them to identify with, some characteristic they possess which they associate with being female. 

My concern is that this might have the effect of reinforcing archaic and restrictive gender roles. I know that the movement has its heart in the right place, with the desire to free everyone to identify with whichever gender they feel is right. But I would frankly rather free everyone from the concept of gender altogether and just let them be themselves, individual people. I feel like we are moving in the opposite direction by trying to establish that the genders really are separate, and that our gender really is important to who we are as people.

"21","leftyknox","CMV: There is no reason, ignoring potential dis/interest, that American colleges/universities should not compete in MMA.","null","13","2","0","2","In a separate discussion on college sports, the idea of colleges/universities participating in MMA seemed, on a gut level, problematic but I could not think of a good reason that they shouldn't.

Obviously MMA involves a certain degree of violence/risk of injuries, but we currently allow for football which has been shown to cause certain health problems, as well as wrestling.

Ultimately, even with football/wrestling/etc., these institutions are allowing students they recruit to make the calculation as to whether the potential risks outweigh the benefits involved.

Additionally, without athletics, some kids who may participate in the proposed MMA league wouldn't get a college education at all otherwise. But at least now, with the degree they'd have attained, they'd at least be better off in regards to finding gainful employment.

Finally, at the college age these same kids could just easily pursue MMA on their own since they're of age. At least now they may get a degree out of it and the risks of being exploited are lesser given they'll be under an institution whose athletics are regulated in theory.

tl;dr - Colleges/Universities shouldn't have any qualms with participating in MMA. 

(Note: I'm not interested in whether or not there is sufficient interest in MMA in colleges/universities, so for the sake of this CMV, assume there is requisite interest from fans/students/etc.)

"22","chinmakes5","CMV: Decreasing taxes and regulation won't do much to create more jobs and increase pay.","null","41","49","0","49","This seems to be a tenet of many CEOs and conservatives. Was watching the CEOs of Citibank and IBM talking about how important this is. They seemed to be alluding to the fact that if they had tax breaks and less regulation they would be expanding. But those two companies had net profits of over $2 billion EACH in the 2nd QUARTER. If $2 billion a quarter isn't enough to spur expansion, how much is enough? 

It isn't just huge companies that are profitable. The stock market has grown by over 250% in the last 8 years. Investors have had record profits while worker's pay has remained flat. 

IMO, right now, the investor has so much power companies can't expand. Expansion is risky. Why mess with record profits? 250% is unsustainable, yet investors pressure companies to beat last years record profits. 
 
 Increased productivity is the buzz word because it is a big reason companies are so profitable. Why would additional profits cause companies to pay more and expand (reduce productivity?) It has been very profitable for companies to run lean and mean.

Now I get that there will be some increased employment, but record profits havn't spurred investment why will adding to that profit change things? Do we need to give investors 20%, 30% or more in yearly profits, increase the debt and increase pollution in return for a slight bump in wages and employment?

The other side believes that expansion happens when demand increases. Increasing salary for the many is a much more effective way to increase demand (for a consumer product) than increasing profits for the few, (which should eventually lead to increased profits for the few anyway.)

"23","elhawiyeh","CMV: It is immoral to expect or require private citizens to stand for the anthem.","null","87","57","0","57","As a child, I remember being told to recite the pledge and put my hand on my heart for the anthem, and doing so only reluctantly. I knew vaguely what I was supporting, but there was never a satisfactory why. Now, in my adult life, I have that answer, but only after weighing seriously if my country as an institution was in fact worth supporting. But at the time I realized I was being compelled to show support for something I didn't really understand.

There is something fundamentally wrong with requiring someone to show allegiance to the country. Enforcing patriotism invites either zealotry or hypocrisy. When we are required to show conviction, what was once genuine sentiment becomes lost in ritual. Standing for one's beliefs becomes compliance with the norm. Self-expression becomes banal conformity.

Genuine respect cannot be compelled

"24","akm327","CMV: Android phones are preferable to Iphones","null","19","9","0","9","I'm new to this sub-reddit and posting here, so if the sub could bear with me a bit that'd be great. Don't bite and all.

While I'm not an aficionado of smartphones or anything, but every time I try and use an Apple smartphone - even the recent ones - it feels way too clunky and restrictive in comparison to a Samsung or other Android brand phone. It's hard for me to see how they got such a massive following and tend to be more successful. I also am aware of a number of the somewhat poor design decisions that they've made recently, such as the headphone jack removal (or something along those lines?) which has further made me question this brand loyalty. I know they were one of the first to get on the smartphone train years ago and made a name for themselves there, but I feel like there are many better brands out there right now. I'd like to hear other's opinions on this since I actually don't really know anyone that buys Apple's Iphones and the like and share much the same view that I do.

"25","mike_kachowski","CMV on blade runner","null","2","7","0","7","The first time I watched br I absolutely loved it. Loved the book, loved the film, especially the way it looked and the tears in rain speech. However, earlier this year i watched the final cut to prepare for the sequel and absolutely hated it. It still looked great and the speech is still fire but there is so much wrong. Dialogue: "time to die" is just awful awful cheesy writing, and it's used twice! On a related not, Batty's accent is all over the place, going from German to English to American with each sentence. The acting is also poor, especially from rutger hauer. From my understanding, replicants are meant to be indistinguishable from humans, so why does he act so weird and robotically? His costumes and hairstyles don't do him any favours either, but it was the 80s I guess. Harrison ford seems completely disinterested in the film, the only time he does anything except monotone and not move his face is in the union rep bit. There's also the weird, uncomfortable and unnecessary rape scene and the screenplay totally butchers the character of deckard; he's meant to be the best blade runner around but he can only retire one by shooting here in the back while she runs away, all the others defeat him. The score is horrifically cringey, especially in the love scenes with that Kenny g style sax, although I do rate the tune under the shot of the towers belching fire. Lastly and worst of all the chase scene at the end. IT MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE. Why does he take his shirt off? Why does he have a dove? What are all those searchlights on the stairs? Why does he spare him? What the actual fuck is going on between the fingers getting broken and them getting onto the roof? I really loved this film and still love the idea of it( a philosophical sci fi noir), so I am really disappointed that it seems to be arthouse bullshit to me now. Please CMV"
