Hello Everyone,

Welcome to CMV Talks IQ2. This is the space in which CMVers can discuss the debate techniques and strategies employed by debators on IQ2 for **September 13, 2017**. The topic is:

&gt;***Against the backdrop of North Korea's nuclear advances and escalating regional tensions, we ask:*** ***How should the U.S. respond to its most urgent national security threats?***

**[Debate Link](https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/unresolved-face-china)**

The original announcement thread with FAQ can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6z3m7w/new_event_cmv_talks_intelligence_squared_debates/). We will edit in links to the podcast and youtube video once it is released. The thread will remain open even after the IQ2 debate concludes.

**RULES:**

- Do ***NOT*** relitigate the proposal. This is not a place to discuss your view on the subject matter. [It may be referred to in order to contextualize your observations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6z3m7w/new_event_cmv_talks_intelligence_squared_debates/)
- Keep the conversation [focused on the meta-conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6z3m7w/new_event_cmv_talks_intelligence_squared_debates/) of what makes a persuasive argument and/or strong debate such as (not limited to): rhetoric, tone, framing, research/data, personal interactions, moderation, clarifying questions.

"1","ImnotfamousAMA","CMV: Getting fountain drinks without ice is better than drinks with ice.","null","177","973","0","973","I firmly believe that ice ruins any fountain drink other than water. There are a couple of reasons for this;

1. If you get a drink with ice and don't drink it all in one sitting (or get a refill to take home) the ice will melt and water down the beverage, making the taste usually significantly worse. 

2. Adding ice to the drink significantly affects the possible volume of the drink. Even if you don't specifically want more to drink, you're still paying the same amount for far less drink when you put ice in the cup. 

Now, the only pro I can see to putting ice in your cup is to make the drink colder. Which while that can be nice, it does take a little while to take affect and very few fountain drinks are drastically improved being cold. 
 
Edit: I've posted about controversial political issues several times before on this sub, yet I've never experienced name calling and insults here. Apparently ice in drinks is an extremely contentious subject."
"2","pupperboy","CMV: Humanity is on a crash course but cognitive dissonance prevents us from realizing it.","null","80","209","0","209","I believe that humanity has several unsolvable problems that will eventually lead to major catastrophe. These include...

* Ecosystem collapse
* Energy/Food shortages due to rising populations
* Inadequate global governance
* Nuclear proliferation

When I vocalize these concerns I get lumped in the doom-and-gloom camp. The expectation seems to be that humanity will rise up and find technological and political solutions for these problems. 

It seems to me that most of the easier gains in science have been realized. It also seems the effort for major advancement in technology seems to be an exponential curve more than a linear one and at some point we won't have the ability to address the technology concern required to support a resting population of 9.5B.

Given that I represent a minority I'm apt to believe their is something wrong in my interpretation of the problem but there is a nagging belief that people, as a whole, simply don't like confronting pessimistic scenarios.

"3","Wil-Himbi","CMV:All two-party consent laws should be repealed and replaced with one-party consent laws.","null","48","77","0","77","Quick Background


These laws concern the electronic recording of conversations both in-person and over the phone. One-party consent laws dictate that a conversation may be recorded if at least one person who is a party to the conversation (that is, openly a part of the conversation), is aware of and consents to the recording. Two-party consent laws counterintuitively require that *all* parties must be aware of and consent to the recording. Both laws make surreptitious recording or eavesdropping illegal.
Federal law is one-party consent. 11 States have two-party consent laws. The remainder have one-party consent laws.
Where the two laws are in conflict (such as an interstate phone call) the two-party consent law prevails.


Further reading:

https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/LAWS-ON-RECORDING-CONVERSATIONS-CHART.pdf


My View


All states with two-party consent laws should repeal them and replace them with one-party consent laws.


My Reasoning


* Being able to freely record all your own phone conversations and in person conversations without needing to inform the other person is an important protection for the common person. It can protect you from sleazy car sales people whose statements contradict the fine print of the contract. It can protect the abused from their abusers and their lies (example [here]( https://np.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6rhwlh/mommy_fearest_and_the_no_good_awful_judge/?st=j7lzpo30&amp;sh=698b2364)). It can protect you when whistleblowing and from sexual harassment and discrimination in the work place. It protects you whenever you are in a situation where you need to expose someone’s lies.
* One-party consent laws also resolve he-said-she-said situations perfectly. Crucially, they protect the weak. They protect people who may not be believed due to cultural bias, such as children, women in the workplace, ex-criminals, people who have developed a “bad reputation” in a small town, and many others.
* Conversely, two-party consent laws protect the powerful. They protect politicians and police officers and other public servants in he-said-she-said situations as they prefer to rely on their reputation. Whose word are you going to believe? This upstanding officer or that young punk? This dedicated politician or the attention-seeking whore? This seems to be a pretty clear case of corruption.
* Outside of a non-disclosure agreement or specific privacy regulations like HIPAA, it is perfectly legal to talk to anyone about a conversation you had, or even to take notes or a transcript of any phone conversation. We see this all the time in all 50 states in the form of witness testimony. The only thing having the ability to record digitally adds is credence to what you say, and convenience.
* Additionally, I view digital recording as a form of memory augmentation. You have a right to remember and talk about any conversation you have already, recording only increases the accuracy of what you remember.


Why I want my view changed


I feel as though I might be unfair towards two-party consent laws. I see no reason for them outside of technophobia and corruption. I’d like to think that eleven states are not that technophobic and corrupt, so maybe I’m just missing something.


So please, CMV!

Edit: Thank you everyone for the nice discussion! I still hold to my original view, but you've given me some good things to think about that I hadn't considered before. I'm signing off for the weekend. I might be able to respond to a few lingering things on Monday, but otherwise this it. I love this sub and the people on it.

"4","itswhatsername","CMV: Wait times in doctor's offices should be limited to 30 minutes, with longer wait times resulting in a free visit","null","29","19","0","19","Over the last few years, I've been dealing with chronic health issues and I've had the misfortune of becoming familiar with outrageous wait times in doctor's offices.

My primary care physician visits regularly take two hours or more, with most of that taking place in the waiting room. I've observed similar wait times in specialist's offices, though I've noticed that this is less common than in primary care offices.

From complaining to my friends who work in the medical industry, it seems that this is pretty common.

My opinion is that doctor's offices should do whatever it takes to see their patients in a timely manner, which for the sake of this CMV I'm limiting to 30 minutes. Offices could schedule fewer appointments and refuse to see patients who are more than, say, 10 minutes late.

If it takes longer than 30 minutes to see the doctor, the visit should be free. Because doctor's offices are generally only open M-F from 8am-5pm, I have to take time off work to see my physicians. When it takes hours to accomplish this task, that either means I'm losing money (if I'm paid hourly) or I'm having to make up hours of work in my free time.

Because of this inconvenience, I believe that long wait times should be compensated with a free visit. This would encourage doctor's offices to avoid over-scheduling and help get patients in and out of the office in a timely manner.

That's my opinion, but I'm open to rethinking it. So CMV, Reddit!

Edited to add that I'm in the US. Not sure if this is an issue in other countries. I also realize that the premise of my argument is rooted in paying for visits, so this isn't relevant in countries with free/universal healthcare."
"5","cmvawaythrow","CMV: I don't think alcoholism is a disease, but rather weakness of will.","null","48","13","0","13","My father is an alcoholic and maintains he has a disease. It was why my mother left him in my early years and why he was not around while I was growing up. Calling it a disease seems like a way to deflect all personal responsibility and accountability. I believe this because it allows people to claim they don't have control over their actions. To me, this is weakness of will, not disease. It is the same as saying, "its not my fault". Some people deal with it before it ruins their lives. I think you have a choice every time you crack a beer. One day he chose to stop. To me, that is because he found the will to do so, not because the disease magically vanished between drinks."
"6","nginx-web-server","CMV: The U.S. could eliminate North Korea without significant military retaliation","null","232","315","0","315","I didn't want to be this specific. I'm not a military expert in any sense, but this subreddit required more than a title. My main point would be that I believe the US military, with morality put aside, could eliminate the North Korean threat without losing a significant part of the South Korean population. You can kind of ignore the below statements. I just wanted to abide by the subreddit rules.

----------------------------------------

[Knowing North Korea holds massive military parades with their leader and a large number of military officials present](https://youtu.be/ZQxW_ipxEEo?t=40m13s), the United States could dedicated a nuclear strike on every North Korean city in addition to militarized areas near the North Korean southern border, eliminating the North Korean threat. With the vast majority of its civilian and military population gone, Seoul and perhaps Incheon could survive without a strong military retaliation. The northern portion of the North Korean peninsula could remain uninhabitable without concern of occupation by Russia, China, or fleeing refugees.

After the North Korean populace is eliminated, retaliation from Russia or China could only be economic in nature and limited the extent that it wouldn't crash their economy. Any military retaliation would be acted in a context where the American military had no qualms with annihilating an entire country using a small portion of its rather large nuclear arsenal."
"7","Blaze_It_Michael_xxx","CMV: I don't think Malala Yousafzai is a hero","null","0","3","0","3","So over the summer I had to read this book I Am Malala for the English class I'm taking now. I've read other CMV threads about her, from people who had my opinion and I'm really still not convinced. I really want to understand this girl and what she did that is so heroic, but opinions are hard to change.

I offered my opinion during an in-class discussion and was shut down so quickly, and for the rest of the class people just looked at me like I was some kind of deranged racist. I'd like to be thought of as normal. A preface: I live in a first world country where education is readily available to anyone and everyone. Another preface: I believe that Malala is standing up for something good, something necessary even.

Malala is mainly considered a hero due to her advocacy and her ability to stand up for what's right when no one else would. I believe that she was brave in her actions, but there are some things that I read, that really prevented me from being able to see this girl as a role model or a hero in any way.

For me, Malala's story is this: she was raised by an unconventional Pakistani family, with a father who would perform customs on her, that were meant to be performed on boys. This defiance was forced onto Malala throughout her early life. Her father also ran girls schools in Pakistan. Then, the Taliban took over her valley and the Taliban tried to prevent girls from getting an education. Now, I'm sure that other Pakistani girls believe and wish that they could advocate for the same things that Malala did, but they knew that what happened to Malala would also happen to them. As in, being hunted down by the Taliban and killed. Malala blogged for the BBC under a fake alias but was ultimately hunted down by the Taliban and was shot. Being shot is not a heroic thing. I'm sure we can agree with that. After that, she was taken to England, and now she partakes in higher education and speaks in first world countries about how necessary education is in Pakistan.

Here's the deal. Malala *was* a hero. Back when she was 12 years old, fighting for girls' education *in* Pakistan, when she knowingly put herself in danger for the chance of making a change, that was heroic. Although I believe that her father was more heroic for actually building schools and running schools in Pakistan that did well, as well as inspiring Malala to become an activist in the first place. But, after she was shot she ran away to England, essentially leaving all of the other girls in Pakistan behind, still with no right to education. Malala speaks in 1st world countries about how important education is in 3rd world countries. Problem with that is, we already know how important education is. That's why education is already available and mandatory to anyone and everyone here. There have actually been petitions that have sparked actual change in Pakistan under Malala's name, but none of these petitions were spearheaded by Malala herself at all, she hasn't partaken in any of these actual changes in Pakistan as far as I know.

I see Malala as nothing but a figurehead and a name who has sparked no change since she got her story out there.

Change my view, please. I'd like to stop getting crucified in english class.

"8","LuciusFlynn","CMV: Using the N-Word in the right context is okay.","null","13","0","0","0","Hello Everyone

I personally think that if it's in the right context it's perfectly okay to use the N-Word (Ni***r). I saw a couple of Videos about the whole Pewdiepie situation (He said the N-Word on stream) and everyone just said: "He said the N-Word". Now I get that they said that because of demonetization but the hysteria about it is stupid.

Many people say that the N-Word is horrible no matter what context, but I believe that is wrong. Obviously when someone goes up to a Person of Color and says: "What's up Ni**er". That is not okay. But when someone does call someone a N-Word and you talk about it, you should be able to use it.

"9","Happy_Laugh_Guy","CMV - The regulations in place that make cutting weight a viable strategy are a hindrance to fighters and the sports they fight in.","null","19","17","0","17","I recently got into doing/watching MMA and boxing. There are fighters at the gym I go to and they have talked a lot about "walking weight" and "fighting weight."

I have been into nutrition and weight lifting for a long time and didn't understand why they made a distinction unless they were trying to gain weight for a fight. It turns out nobody does that.

Fighters will walk around 20lbs heavier than their weight class with the intention of cutting water weight ~5 days before a fight to make weigh in. Elite boxers and MMA fighters literally make the decision to completely dry themselves out to make weigh in so they can try to use science to gain that weight back overnight.

It turns out a lot of athletes get very sick sometimes when cutting weight. You can suffer organ failure and all kinds of other stuff.

Just recently, the number one pound for pound best MMA fighter on the planet didn't get to fight because his opponent couldn't make weight. So fans are left seriously let down they didn't get to see the fight. This hurts the sport.

When you cut that much weight, outside of the risk of serious injury, you also don't gain as much strength or stamina back overnight even with rehydration. You're weaker, slower, and overall a worse fighter than if you'd been able to properly eat and rest before the fight to be at your peak physical condition. So fans again don't get as good of a show and the fighters put themselves at risk again after the cut by not being their best selves in the ring or octagon.

My view could be changed if a good argument can be made for why there shouldn't be a rule that says fighters need to weigh the correct weight inside of their weight class on the same day as the fight. This rule exists in high school wrestling, likely as a preventive measure to keep kids from killing themselves to make weight. I need a good reason why we shouldn't have the same expectation for elite professional fighters."
"10","tempaccount920123","CMV: The US gov't should invest trillions (5-7) into environmentally safe silicon mining and production for both solar and processor chip manufacturing","null","59","12","0","12","The goal: get electricity prices down to $.01 per kwh (or lower), for every consumer household in America, not by direct government subsidy, but by providing solar panels for every municipality, federal building and private citizen for home use (no ebay reselling, etc.) by request. 

Private panels would be owned by the private sector, but the loans would be provided by the government, and the federal government would have its own massive amount of gov't panels. I'm talking panels on every federal building, on the side of highways, on federal land where appropriate, on every bare commercial roof, etc. - not by government mandate, but by simply the laws/theories/mores of economics.

I'm not talking anything crazy in solar electric technology - just your standard SolarCity variety photoelectric panels, except the feds would have cheap loans and government work projects to literally open solar panel factories.

Edit: I think that a staggered deployment on incentives, direct government work programs, block grants, training programs, etc. with a timeframe of 10 years (5-7 trillion OVER 10 years) could be doable, once you accept in the initial ridiculousness of my proposal.

Edit2: [It has been pointed out to me that Alaska, as well as other remote areas, would need multiple energy storage solutions, as well as increased access to an effective electrical grid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/70a9fw/cmv_the_us_govt_should_invest_trillions_57_into/dn1lrog/)

I've thought long and hard about this, and I'd like a counteropinion:

Disadvantages:

* Cannot happen without political support, and given the current Congress, it would never happen.

* Complete disruption of the energy industry in America. Natural gas would die out, along with *any* remaining coal plants, nuclear would die as well.

* Complete disruption of the manufacturing and commercial industries in America.

* Would speed up automation and many millions of people would lose their jobs, and tens of millions would need to be educated/retrained for jobs that require critical thinking for design and troubleshooting needs. Trucking in America would die, though.

* Would temporarily increase the deficit massively.

* Would require tens/hundreds of billions of dollars to research/evaluate how to mine silicon-based solar panels effectively and environmentally friendly (rare earths aren't rare, they're just hard to get to - http://www.npr.org/2011/01/31/133372641/california-challenges-china-in-rare-earths-mining), and then trillions to pay companies/people to make their own solar companies and hand out research grants.

* As any basic economics student knows, lowered costs, generally, increase consumption. Electricity consumption would skyrocket.

* The current economic system is set up entirely around a petroleum based economy - gas stations everywhere, long haul trucking transports 75% of consumer goods in the US, public transportation is almost nonexistent for most of the US landmass, and just look at our involvement in the Middle East over the past 100 years.

Advantages

* Virtually limitless energy for America. We could provide basically free electricity to every man, woman and child.

* Lowering of costs for production of goods.

* With lowered costs, it'd be easier to make currently expensive scrubbers, as well as running basically electrically charged fans that collected pollutants from out of the air. Basically this: http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/08/asia/china-pollution-artist/index.html with more engineering.

* Metal refining costs would plummet. Use of aluminum would skyrocket.

* With lowered costs of raw goods refining, prices for basically everything would come down.

* Ease of concrete production - while there is a carbon dioxide/greenhouse gas problem caused by the literal production of concrete, concrete roads last longer than asphalt roads and there are literally millions of tons of concrete structures that need replacing in America.

* We would be able expand our capability in research simply because electricity costs would be negligible.

* We would be able to export electricity to other countries in massive quantities.

* Public works projects would be easier and cheaper because of electrically run equipment that could be made in bulk.

* Because of suddenly cheap steel, aluminum, copper, etc., public transportation systems would suddenly become a lot more viable for many municipalities.

* With cheap electricity, everyone would be able to run their computers for research purposes, all of the time. 

* Recycling efforts would skyrocket because running industrial electrical equipment would become ridiculously cheap.

* If we could figure out how to perform electrical osmosis on trash/nuclear waste, we'd be set: https://www.wired.com/2012/01/ff_trashblaster/

* There aren't *too* many differences between photoelectric silicon chips and computer grade processors.

* Do you have a shortage of water? Well, just use electrical osmosis to make as much fresh water as you need from the ocean!

* If you need potable water, say, for a municipal water plant? Electrical osmosis, and then putting in a blend of purified minerals/whatever, would be an ideal solution.

* Fracking, natural gas production would plummet.

* A jobs program into training electricians could provide hundreds of thousands of well paying jobs.

* In the future, due to lowered costs, educational resources and a further emphasis on electrically-based manufacturing, as well as electrically-intensive computation would be easier.

* We could speed up nuclear fusion research, as more test plants could be built, and even though the current ones are using 15 megawatts and capturing 10, we could simply throw more plants at the problem and shotgun a solution in much less time.

"11","curiousone6151","CMV: It is in your best interest to do the things that increases your personal utility (like things that make you happy or that is helpful to you)","null","27","4","0","4","1) The https://givingpledge.org provides various reasons that are against this view:

*It is in your best interest to do the things that increases your personal utility (like things that make you happy or that is helpful to you)*

Though not all the reasons are against this view, but at least over 50% seems to be. If you are giving/investing into something you support or care about, you are effectively increasing your personal utility.

Utility is something you learn from economics 101, and conceptually, exists in other fields, though it's not something much talked about comparative to everything else in society, so we should talk.

2) Say one of you says that [humanity would be doomed](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/709khv/cmv_humanity_is_on_a_crash_course_but_cognitive/) if you did things that increases your personal utility like in 

Though personal utility also directly &amp; indirectly leads to innovation and many other goods, but the key point is that it is still in your best interest to do things that increases your personal utility because you would have, in sum, a net positive outcome.

So if you would doing things that increases your personal utility, you would ultimately not be doing things that doomed humanity.
 
3) There is also [no debt to help anyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/708qf2/cmv_the_western_world_has_no_obligation_to_help/) if it doesn't increase your personal utility

Morally, increasing your personal utility could be seen as the best moral way to go about doing things [as related to other close topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/706jf3/cmv_all_moral_philosophies_are_at_their_core/)

In the end, this proposition would still be in your best interest.

This is because there are no absolute or measurable reasons why we are to owe anyone else. This point on debt/obligation/responsible/owing is one of the various reasons made in the giving pledge as well.

4) [If a phone or some device was not better](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/705n7c/cmv_stating_the_technological_superiority_of_a/) for you, then it's not increasing your personal utility and you therefore should not use such phone or device.

5) Kids can be cute and you made not have had sufficient personal growth in your life, or may not have been acculturated sufficiently so [you may like to touch little kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7054w6/cmvmorally_there_is_nothing_wrong_with_pedophiles/)

In the historical past, little kids were married early on, and were taken care of, in more than one way, by her or his caretaker. So all of this is cultural.

And a person increasing their personal utility is in their best interest in all and every case in this universe. What is in your best interest is always going to be an increase in personal utility.

An important topic would be trade-offs, but doing things in your best interest is one of the most important things to understand first about life.

Western countries have enough problems as it is. 

I believe that people should donate to charities on their own accord if they want to, but having a dedicated government fund for development aid is (in my opinion) a waste of money.

Immigration is the same story, why is the western world obligated to just take everyone in and take care of them? Maybe makes us all feel good, but the African population will only get bigger and so by taking everyone in, we solve nothing!

Yet political attempts to even moderately hamper domestic economic activity- the only way to seriously combat global ecological damage besides wait around for more efficient tech- die almost on arrival. It took years for the Paris Accords to be hammered into place. The goalposts were extremely small and the measures were utterly non-binding. Places like China have only gotten around to recognizing environmental as an issue because their people are choking on the air, and they’re on the brink of attempting to move away from an industrial economy.

Even if Europe, China, and the United States impose draconian environmental controls, there’s still billions of people on the planet living close to the absolute poverty line who are waiting in line for their turn to have an industrial revolution. In Africa especially. Nigeria is industrializing, and that's 173.6 million people alone- and projected to be a lot more. Africa has huge amounts of untapped resources due to their instability- instability caused in large part due to poverty. Economic growth would both give them the means and space with which to start exploiting those resources. The continent as a whole is projected by the U.N. to explode from 1 to 2.4 billion people between now and 2050. By 2100 it is projected to be somewhere around 4.5 billion. This is taking into account projected slowdown in population growth. These people will demand higher standards of living, and the best way their governments have of doing so is industrializing their economies. Each time someone switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy it lowers the demand, and thus ultimately price, of said fossil fuels for other parties. Each environmental control on businesses imposed by a developed country increases their economic opportunity by picking up the slack. Of creating cheap exports and becoming the “China” of the 21st century with all of the pollution that comes with it. 

Unless you believe in some kind of crippling genetic inferiority that will prevent Africans from accomplishing this, then it is seemingly inevitable without outside intervention. You simply can’t sell environmental protection to populations who are miserably poor. Africans at large would rightly accuse the developed world of trying to cut out the ladder from under them after they had their turn.

People like to imagine Malthusian nightmares where we run out of food from overpopulation. They miss the fact that in many ways we are already living in a sort of Malthusian nightmare. We’ve killed off species of plants and animals so rapidly that many have dubbed human civilization “the sixth great extinction” on the same magnitude as when astroids hit, boiled the oceans and blackened the sky for months.

Yes, these population have the future potential to help us accelerate wealth and technology creation, but the engine temperature of the natural world is running a bit too high. It’s in all of our interests to slow it down before it blows, but doing so requires people to make sacrifices. People don’t want to make sacrifices. At most the majority of people will recycle, buy organic, and take “green-friendly” lifestyle options. Drops in the bucket of the global economic system. So the next obvious step is to remove the option to choose.

It is my view that a weaponized virus should be released at multiple locations in high-density developing countries. Preferably the developing world would then close their borders, and give them time to develop countermeasures. Doing so in a way that targeted major developed country would not only risk pointlessly shredding intellectual capital, but it would also risk thermonuclear war due to accusations over who is responsible. Collateral damage from failure to quarantine is in my eyes an acceptable risk. If successful this would relieve strain on the environment and allow survivors to reconstruct life in a sustainable way. 

Pie-in-the-sky theories about how we will all be saved by advancing technology fail to impress me. It’s not that I don’t believe we won’t continue to make technological breakthroughs. I simply don’t trust that it will be enough to decrease our strain on the environment given massive global population growth and the increased demand that accompanies it. The consequences are too delayed, and too great in magnitude. As the environment destabilizes progress will only grow more difficult. Crop failure, freak storms, and drought are all on the menu. Planetary escapism is most likely more cruel than the solution I propose- at best only a couple million people could be moved to Mars. Other solutions that I have seen seem hopelessly naiive and altruistic or simply fall short of tangibly addressing the problem.

I don’t believe in this strategy because I have any malicious intent. I only do because the stakes are so high. We are currently running the risk of dooming future generations to a world where the carrying capacity of the planet drops. In this environment I don’t believe that human civilization can survive, due to runaway inter-nation conflict. One only has to look now at how nations behave even in a century of unprecedented economic growth to feel black fear in their chest at the prospects of a world where there is economic contraction. In fact, the 1930’s were a good enough example of how nations act when there is severe economic contraction. Bloody revolution and world war, but this time with nuclear proliferation involved. I believe that there is ample reason to think that increased tension in this way would lead to runaway regional arms races and nuclear proliferation that could very well destroy humanity. 

These thoughts have weighed rather heavily on me for the past few months. If someone could convince me that my diagnosis of the situation was wrong, I would be quite grateful.

"14","KingMarshmalo","CMV: The electro-wizard is the best card in Clash Royale.","null","0","1","0","1","The electro wizard is by far the most useful card. This isn't about E-wiz being OP or not, it's about being best compared to the cards already in the game. 

Also, mega knight shouldn't be part of the discussion because it's new, I haven't seen it often enough to appropriately gauge its strength, and it's likely to be nerfed shortly after release like most new cards. 

1. **E-wiz is one of the best defenses against the infamous tank + balloon binary combo** because of its ability to strike two targets. This is OP because it can kill the balloon without dying to things like zap, arrows, and log, which would kill many other counters to this combo (minions behind the golem being the biggest). A friend of mine says that wizard can do the same thing, but that relies on the balloon hugging the golem while moving, or the wizard has to be put behind the golem, whereas the e-wiz can strike from the safety of being in front of the golem. 

2. **The E-wiz is a zap that can be used on your side, saving 2 elixir in many scenarios.** This is just so useful, and can prevent you from spending 2 elixir on a zap, thus saving 2 elixir if you were going to play the E-wiz regardless. 

3. **It serves as a superior defense against hogs and princesses.** Other counters that take 2 hits to kill will result in the princess still squeezing out a shot, whereas the E-wiz can stop the princess even if it attacks while she's about to release her first shot. 

There's no better counter against the hog rider for 4 elixir (better being measured by likelihood of preventing the hog from hitting the tower). Especially in conjunction with other troops, it's almost certain that a hog going to a tower with an e-wiz next to it is not going to survive. 

4. **It completely invalidates the existence of the prince, inferno dragon, inferno tower, and sparky.** The entire existence of these cards are voided on the battlefield when the E-wiz is there due to the E-wiz being able to dish out a zap every 1.8 seconds. 

5. **The e-wiz deals a relatively large amount of damage to towers if left alone compared to other units of similar role.** ALL of us have come to one point or another where we had to let a mid-range versatile unit (that costs 4-5 elixir) pound our tower with shots while the unit is at full health, and are forced to endure the damage to our tower, it's just part of the game. 

However the E-wiz brings this to the next level by prolonging its life by minimizing the amount of times it's shot by the tower through zapping the tower. This makes the E-wiz especially brutal when left alone compared to similar cards. 

6. **It has an ample supply of health and damage in proportion to its utility.** It has health and damage that's on par with similar cards that don't have the same utility. Take the musketeer for the example, compared to the E-wiz it's shit. The musketeer does 24 less damage (when the E-wiz has one target) and has a measly 8 more health (tournament level for both of these numbers), yet it costs the same elixir and doesn't have the spawn damage and zap hitting that the E-wiz has. 

7. **The E-wiz is very useful for supporting pushes, and can often transform an 1800 HP push into a tower-taking push.** By zapping the tower it minimizes damage output against other units that it's fighting alongside, which adds incredible potency to otherwise non-lethal pushes. 

The Electro-Wizard is the overall best card in Clash Royale when "best" is measured by the most useful health, damage, and utility for the set elixir amount. 

It's going to take either showing how the E-wiz is near average compared to its peers or making the case for a better card to change my view.

"15","thesite94","CMV: The Elder Scrolls series is many times better than the Fallout series","null","28","2","0","2","Title is pretty self explanatory, I don't really understand why people think fallout is better than TES. Granted, my experience with TES is mostly with Oblivion and Skyrim+ DLCs (I tried to go back and play some of the earlier versions but I found the mechanics just too frustrating) 

My experience with the Fallout series is about the same Fall Out 3, New Vegas and Fallout 4. Each time a new game comes out I try my best to get into it but I find the games empty, boring and repetitive. Listed below are the reasons why and my arguments for why the Elder Scrolls is much better

**1. Bland environments**

Fallout has some of the most boring, monochromatic and empty maps I've ever seen. Seriously, you'd think centuries after the war at least you'd get some vegetation. But no, its all wastelands with random mediocre trinkets and weapons sprinkled around but with nothing interesting or any landscapes worth exploring. Skyrim and oblivion on the other hand have vibrant, thriving landscapes that have something new around every corner packed with character interaction and quests (quests are seriously lacking in FO)

**2. Graphics and Mechanics**

I know Skyrim and Oblivion arent know for their advanced graphics, but God, fallout looks like a PS1 port of a game and it's shooting mechanic are clunky and horrible. To me, VATS is completely immersion breaking although it is useful in the beginning. I know I mentioned that some earlier TES games were clunky but Im glad they revamped them with Skyrim, but 3 and New Vegas are horrible (you cant even attempt certain things if your skill is too low, at least Skyrim lets you try even though you'll most likely fail) 

**3. Boring missions/ storylines**

I will admit I never really finished that many questlines in the fallout series, but all came across as very cookie cutter "errand boy" type of missions that all lead to the same ending. I will give credit to New Vegas for its complex cause/ effect trees though. Skyrim on the other hand felt so vibrant and exciting (exploring massive ruins, complete exciting quests and actually do stuff that felt like you were making an impact in the game)

"16","VStarffin","CMV: All moral philosophies are, at their core, utilitarian.","null","116","76","0","76","So let me explain.

Firstly, I want to be clear that I'm only talking about moral philosophies which *actually exist* and have adherents. I'm not saying its impossible to construct a moral philosophy which isn't utilitarian. I'm saying no such philosophies exist in the human world with anything like broad or anything more than de minimis adherence, and that they never will.

Second, let's break some things down. When I say "utilitarian", I don't just mean the old, simple utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill. I'm speaking a little more broadly, and perhaps it's more accurate to say that all moral philosophies are *consequentialist*. In other words, every moral philosophy ultimately derives its legitimacy, justification and adherence from the idea that if you obey such and such philosophy, you will have a better overall outcome than if you didn't. Meaning you will experience a subjective sense of happiness and joy *greater than* the alternative. So things like Rawlsian Veils of Ignorance of Rule Utilitarian structures are perfectly allowable - the key feature is that moral decisions are being made based on whether they lead to happiness and reduce suffering (both broadly defined).

The main philosophies which are not normally conceived of as utilitarian are (i) religion and (ii) secular deontology. So lets break that down a little.

* **Religion**. Religion is often seen as the exact opposite of utilitarian/consequentialism. In religion, things are immoral because either god commands them to be so, or they are build into the nature of the universe as such (no need to litigate the Euthyphro dilemma in this particular thread). And so many religions say that things are right or wrong, regardless of consequence. They simply are so. The problem here is twofold. First, in order to get people to believe this, many religions *promise heaven*. They basically say that if you follow the rules, you'll get into heaven, and if not you'll get into hell. This is the ultimate form of consequentialism - it's a system which says "if you follow the rules, a good subjective outcome will occur, and if you don't, a bad subjective outcome will occur". Nothing could be more consequentialist. The second prong here is that as far as I can tell there are no religions which say that God's rules lead to a worse world. So even without heaven and hell, I'm not aware of any religion which says "these are the rules, and following them leads to a worse world with more suffering and pain *for everyone* than not following them, but you should follow them anyways beause God says so.

* **Secular deontology**. This is the secular parallel of religion, and its very common among, well, western philosophy in general. This is the battle cry of many libertarians, for exampe, who say that there are certain "natural laws" which can't be violated. Things like property and liberty and not violating consent. But much like the religion point, you're left with the same dilemma. People like me thing property and liberty and consent is great, but we believe it to be great because of the *empirical fact* that lifting up those ideals makes people's lives happier and better and reduces suffering. It's fundamentally a very utilitarian argument. Similar to religion, I have never seen a secular deontologist say "if I knew with 100% certainty that the natural laws I believe in led to more pain and suffering, with less happiness and joy, than abandoning them, I would still believe in them."

IN this sense, utilitarianism is not a prescription - it's not telling you what you *should* do when you make moral choices. Rather, it's descriptive - it's telling you what you *are doing already* without realizing it, in the hope that making you conscious of your utilitarian instincts will help refine your thinking.

So, that's my argument. Convince me I'm wrong. A few things I can think would persuade me are:

* Are there more alternatives than consequentialism, religion and deontology? Have I missed another option?
* Have I misdiagnosed religion or deontology?

"17","atta_turk","CMV: Gerrymandering has no solution in the current US political system","null","35","45","0","45","The way I see it, even in an *ideal* scenario, there is no perfect solution to the partition of districts within a population. In my head for the following points I am referencing the typical example of a 5x10 grid that can be split up different ways, with fives districts, twenty red boxes, and thirty blue boxes. Either you have districts that are competitive (leading to a 5-0 majority for blue) or you have districts that represent the overall voter composition (3 blue to 2 red districts, but there is no competition within the districts). Both of these scenarios are unhealthy for the democracy, and it think it is apparent why.

In my amateur knowledge of the subject, the best way to fix gerrymandering would be to adopt a form of proportional representation that did not geographically separate voters at all. I know there are issues with removing the geographic ties of a seat (although I'll be honest and say I think those don't make much sense in practice) and that proportional systems give more power to party leaders and centrists, but in terms of gerrymandering it seems like the best solution.

Maybe there is also an electoral system that is proportional but allows for party outsiders to have a voice? My guess would be something like STV within a party?"
"18","Obtainer_of_Goods","CMV: Documentaries are inherently unreliable, they start with a conclusion and then manufacture evidence in order to fit that conclusion.","null","64","247","0","247","I'll be honest, I don't know much about the production and approval process for documentaries but this is how I imagine it: Someone has an idea for a documentary, they get the idea approved, and it is the filming of the documentary then consists of the filmmakers trying to justify their conclusions by manufacturing visual and auditory evidence. Whether it is by finding experts who match the opinion of the film-maker, or taking footage which is supposed to elicit a certain emotional or intellectual response in the audience. No opposing views are taken into consideration unless their purpose is so that filmmakers can show how their view can stand scrutiny, when in reality they are avoiding their harshest or most sensible critics. 

This is the opposite of science and is a recipe for confirmation bias. Before you watch a documentary you should decide whether the conclusion of the documentary is true, before you see it. And even then only if you want to hold an even stronger view on the topic than you do now, because most documentaries try to invoke emotional responses in order to get the audience on their side.

If you want to change my view I would recommend pointing out some review process which is inherent in all documentaries. Or a review process which says which documentaries are trustworthy and which aren’t.

"20","alfu30b","CMV: Blackface is not a problem, as long as you don't do it to actively shame black people.","null","212","298","0","298","This came up during a conversation about Cosplays with some of my friends (we're all white Europeans). We talked about which characters we wanted to do at some point. More as a joke I said Doomfist (a black hero from Overwatch). Some giggled about it, but one of my friends just stared at me and said "what, no. You can't do this, you're not black". She didn't like my response "well I can just use make-up" at all, getting angry about that it would be blackfacing (I never heard that term before, actually), wouldn't be appropriate and would shame black people.

As far as I understand it, Cosplay, dressing up etc. is about being /symbolizing a character you really like, or trying out something you wouldn't do in normal, public situations. You want to look like the character, as close as possible (or you want to do your own interpretation of it, which is also possible). So, what if I really liked Doomfist, because he's strong, because I loved to play him, because I found his character concept interesting, and because of that, wanted to cosplay him? When I paint my face black to look like him, it's actually the opposite of trying to make fun of shame black people. It says that I want to look like that black man, because I think he's cool.

Don't get me wrong, if you do it to make fun, shame or harass black people, it's obviously a pretty bad thing to do, but for cosplay?

I have no problem with black people using make-up to look like a white person for a cosplay. Why should I have one with the opposite?"
"21","ExplosionExpert","CMV: Religion is now unneccessary in the modern world and should be phased out through the ban of teaching religious education in all schools except for the historical study of religion.","null","261","211","0","211","Right so my writing skills are pretty bad so please stick with me and thanks in advance. Also I may have to make the case for athiesm first so skip to the next paragraph if you're already on board with that before I talk about antitheism. Also real quick I don't get why atheists are called edgy when they say that praying against a hurricane is stupid or whatever.(probably a bad example but you get my point)

Atheism is the belief system that is most based in reason in sense. Anything that can be proven and retried and reproven is true until something else that is more true comes along (e.g. Newtonian physics to Einsteinian Physics (probably not the right word but you get my point)) and anything that can't be proven is reduced to the simplest and most likely explanation. and anything beyond that is a shrug followed by research. So is it more likely that in the case of Catholics(90% sure they're the fundamentalist ones, if not that's who I'm talking about) ~6000 years ago a being of insane power created a world with 1 man and then created a woman by tearing out his rib and making a woman. Despite somehow making the man without the rib in the first place so why the hell did he need a rib. And then the entire diverse world of 7 billion people happened 6000 years later without any inbreeding problems or issues when a few thousand years later the entire world was completely flooded and the water just vanished 4 days later. Like all these highly unlikely or entirely disproven events don't line up with our evidence. So we go on to the next one. Is it more likely that Jesus resurrected a dead man, healed the blind from nothing, rose from the dead, walked on water, etc. or is it more likely that it was written as a story to tell people not to be an asshole? It's much more likely it's a story written to tell people not to be an asshole as those things are impossible/unlikely and unprovable. And evidence is not self evident by the way. So you can't say it's in the bible so it must be true because it's the word of God and the bible says it is the word of God. Other religious follow the same rules.Is it disprovable? If yes, bye. If no, is it provable? If so, holyshit show me. If not is it the simplest and most likely answer? Through this we get to a situation that seems to be fairly accepted. ~14 billion years ago the universe existed from a singularity and expanded rapidly and a few billion years later the solar system formed and a few billion years later we had life develop after chemical reactions eventually became complicated enough that that could reproduce and change over time to continue their chemical reactions and do better chemical reactions that allowed for more energy and more growing. and on and on until people. All on the atheist's train of understanding? Cool bananas. (Stuff I wrote may or may not be entirely correct with times and such as I'm working from memory)

Right so this is my main point. I don't think that religion is necessary in modern society any more and we need to remove it through banning religious teachings as fact or an available belief system. (If we could snap our fingers and not have any religion of any kind anymore that'd be awesome but it seems feasible to stop religion in modern society now so that's my goal.)

1. Religion as an organisation is poisonous to society, churches living off of donations from people and paying no taxes is unfair and is parasitic to those poor people lead to believing in a religion and paying their way into heaven or whatever. Like that George Olsteen or whatever his name was with his megachurch raking in millions and spouting absolute wank and those speaking in tongue things. What the hell is that?

2. Religion is a basis for a bad way of thinking. Having people unquestioningly following a man's word from a single book as fact doesn't really set a good mindset for critical thinking skills and questioning things you hear. Like if I hear anything on the news I think "Is this going to affect me if it is true? If yes, find out if it is true, if not it doesn't matter." Most of the time it doesn't affect me so I don't need to research that much. Even it's a news story my political biases agree with I'll look it up so I don't use it as an argument later and look like a fool.

3. Religion is not necessary for community and societal problems. This is the one point I see as making my view an issue. It also requires a little societal contruction. While I do think towns and cities need some kind of community centre I think we could change those churches and mosques to community centres where we could have weekly or bi-weekly talks and meetings with tea and biscuits, even a confessional if you really need one because I can see that being helpful. Just a place for people to make friends and meet up every week is definitely helpful to the elderly and is nice to have. It doesn't need to be religious based just a place that people can go to to feel safe and around friends. I feel this is worded horribly but the gist is we can have people going to church every weekend to get their fix of hanging out in a community but it doesn't need to be religious.

4. "Religion is necessary for moral compasses." No it isn't. I've been atheistic all my life and I know not to rape, murder and pillage. I know a lot of athiests, they don't rape, murder and pillage because that's not very helpful to everyone. Not only is it illegal and will mess your life up but as a human being killing other people just feels wrong and that's why shit like PTSD happens. Murders are either mental, defending themselves or in a bad state of mind. (Maybe other reasons but I think that's all)

5. It provides a vector for discrimination. This one a bit of a weak argument as shit people will always be around probably. But cutting down on the number of ways to discriminate against people is a good start. To be honest a better fix would probably be to get some hardcore society construction and prevent communities of similarly minded people from living together so you have to learn to respect other people for who they are.

They are probably other arguments I've missed, I'll add them here after answering them in the comments. But I think that's it for now. Thanks for reading!

"22","fightingmvc","CMV: The ending of "Hamilton" is a real downer","null","18","5","0","5","So recently I got into the musical Hamilton, and I think it’s great. I’ve only listened to audio recordings. For the first couple of days, I always stopped listening some time in the first or early second act, but yesterday I finally got to the actual ending, and it left me with a weird feeling.

I get that Hamilton has to die, because they make the duel imagery do a lot of work throughout the plot, and, well, he did die that way. And the character arcs in the second act, leading up to and including the actual duel scene, are good and compelling. But everything after the duel is weird, depressing and unsatisfying. 

Note: I’ll discuss details of the plot, the ending and some individual songs.



Alexander Hamilton’s death song is barely a song at all, it’s disjointed and seems to take up a bunch of previous plot threads and motifs at random. I guess it’s realistic that this is what a dying person would think, but what does it give the listener? Compare this to main characters’ deaths in other pieces of musical theatre, where they generally get some sense of resolution. Burr’s last song right after Hamilton’s death is a good example: He reviews his role in the plot and makes some philosophical statements about it, his arch is concluded in a satisfying way, and he doesn’t even die. The song is still somewhat depressing, since he mostly expresses regret.

The final song doesn’t do much to bring your spirits up, either. It’s the whole cast singing about how Hamilton will be remembered. They sing about him being less well remembered than the other founding fathers. “Who tells your story?” — well, the musical I’m listening to does. So it seems strangely self-congratulatory and tone-deaf. 

After that, his widow sings about what she did for her remaining life. She did have some interesting achievements, but she’s not the character we care about in this story, and she knows it: Everything she describes ties back to Hamilton, and she cares about who tells his story, not hers. And then the song just sort of fades away and the musical is over.



The first act is very energetic, it describes a young man with a lot of hunger for change making his way in the world. The second act seems like a downward trajectory overall, as his political goals become entangled in everyday politics, and his personal life falls apart. And then the ending puts the cap on it — it’s a depressing story of failure and, in the text though not outside of it, failure to leave a lasting impression.

I feel that the first act raises expectations that the plot doesn’t keep. It doesn’t follow the normal path of tragedy either, since the tone and overall events remain upbeat well into the second act. So why suddenly turn around and make it depressing at the end? The message of the musical seems to be a celebration of America as a nation of immigrants, so why doesn’t it end on a note that leaves viewers thinking about this idea? Instead, they’ll just feel vaguely down, not even sad.

I’d like to change my view in one of the following ways:

A) The ending isn’t actually depressing. Maybe there’s a different way to read it.

B) There’s a good reason for the ending to be depressing. I don’t just mean “they meant for it to be depressing”, I mean that it makes sense within the structure and message of the piece.

C) There are some visuals in the show that change the feeling of the end a lot compared to pure audio.

"23","HennessyHenry","CMV:Morally there is nothing wrong with pedophiles","null","87","23","0","23","I'm a freshman in college, and in my English class we wrote papers on whatever topic that interested us. I flipped through a couple documentaries, and I found one about this "Pedophile Hunter" who would pose as a young boy, and lure pedophiles to locations via some online messaging board so he could publicly humiliate them. As the justice hungry 18 year old I am, I thought, "Right on, your doing good work man." to the guy who confronted these pedophiles. Later on in the documentary they had police officers give their opinions of this "vigilante" work, and how dangerous it is for untrained people to dole out justice. Then they had a therapist talk about how our society has created a climate of animosity that makes it impossible for non-confronting pedophiles to seek the needed treatment. This really shook up my moral compass, I was all for the death of anyone who even thought of molesting a child, but what he said made sense. I like talking about morals, and I became obsessed with the topic, but when I shared my paper with my peers they seemed disgusted with me. My paper said that being a pedophile was a sexual orientation. No sane person would choose to like children, right?You'd get hunted by the pedophile hunter. In the south it would put you in a disadvantage to be gay, so why don't they just flip the gay switch off? They can't. Just to be clear I am not homophobic, Im just using Homosexuality as an example of sexual orientations being beyond our control. Anything beyond our control is not subject to moral evaluation. Finally I think that being a non-confronting pedophile should not be taboo so there is a climate that makes seeking help easier puting less children at hazard, the production of child pornography such as fictional stories, and computer generated graphics should be legal (Ugh, i really struggled typing that one...), but any actual footage of CP should give you life in prison.

I also think that our views of pedophilia as societal whole are a bit primitive, and maybe down the road it will become more acceptable like how homosexuality has become. 

Is this a understandable perspective to have? am I crazy?
It feels so wrong, but i'm sure Hitler thought it was wrong to let Jews live.

https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2017/07/canada_s_leadershiponsexualandreproductivehealthandrights.html In response to this article, I believe that Canada is giving away too many resources to help other countries, when we have problems of our own that would benefit from the funding. We currently have a opioid epidemic, that could benefit from those funds. That money could be used to promote education around the dangers of drug use, and rehab facilities. The funding could also be used to tackle the social determinants of health that further put individuals at risk of living a life style of addiction. Low socioeconomic status, lack of general education, and unemployment are all determinants that could put individuals more at risk of poor health (whether it be with addiction, or physical health). The funding could be used to tackle our problems with unemployment, and be used to make healthy foods and education more accessible to the general population. Using our funding to support other nations has no benefit to helping our problems, and considering its the people of Canada that pay taxes, those funds should be put towards helping our problems.

"25","BAWguy","CMV: It seems that when it comes to identity theft, crime does pay","null","16","37","0","37","I'm reading all this coverage about the recent Equifax hacks and it's basically all like

&gt;How to know if you are affected:
&gt;
&gt;You are affected

and

&gt;It will be hard to prove that someone is taking out a loan in your name 15 years down the line is because of this. But it could happen.

No part of combatting this seems easy, from the initial step of just knowing if you are affected (again, thanks SO much to everyone saying "everyone is affected." So helpful!), to securing your shit if you are, to even the concern of someone sitting on your shit for decades and then totally getting away with this.

Am I wrong to have the impression that relatively speaking, it seems easy as hell to steal an identity? Like what the hell, am I a sucker for working for a living instead of being an identity hacker? Normal people can't even figure out step 1 here.

Like in addition to the ethical consequences of stealing something huge, normally there is the consequences that society will eventually make you pay. Stolen cars get turned up, drug dealers get snitched on, bank robbers get caught in a million ways.
But with identity theft we don't even know how to confirm a crime has been committed! Does crime pay in this case, or what?
